<p>
    <b>Information Systems</b>
    <br>Information Systems offers a strong, practical focus in designing, developing and evaluating databases and management information systems to support business and managerial operations in publishing, media and communication environments.</br>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Business & Information Systems</b>
    <br>Information Systems professionals serve as the critical link between technology and business. As an Information Systems professional, you will work on collaborative teams to design, analyze, implement, deploy and evaluate the computing systems that drive modern enterprise. You will take data and transform it into organizational knowledge, enabling people to access the information to predict the future and make informed decisions that propel business.</br>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Computer Science</b>
    <br>Computer scientists think logically to build and implement computer algorithms, work with operating systems, databases, firewalls and web servers – and write programs for computer gaming, mobile computing, and wireless systems.</br>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Data Science</b>
    <br>Data Science specialists are expected to make informed architectural decisions based on a firm understanding of how available technologies differ and complement each other. As a Data Scientist, you will build and analyze predictive models from data using machine learning and statistical inference, program data science applications in high-level languages and extract patterns from large datasets using high-performance computing and distributed computing methods.</br>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Cybersecurity and Privacy</b>
    <br>In addition to in-depth knowledge of security mechanisms, standards, and state-of-the-art capabilities, you will also be able to design, develop and operate advanced security techniques and cryptographic systems, which require both a deep understanding of theoretical security concepts and detailed knowledge of security practices. Moreover, you will be able to conduct research on both existing and emerging security threats and the interplay between security and other computing disciplines.</br>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Human Computer Interaction</b>
    <br>Human-Computer Interaction practitioners are skilled in incorporating user experience design, psychology, and ergonomics into building computer applications. As a Human-Computer Interaction expert, you will conduct surveys and focus group studies to measure user attitudes and behavior to create designs that provide outstanding user experiences.</br>
